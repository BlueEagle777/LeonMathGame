The following list details the types of equations players can expect at each of the 9 standard races in each map. For example, the first standard race for the addition map will feature equations that involve the sum of two single-digit numbers without the need to carry for the correct answer.

For plus equations:

1) Single digit without carry
2) Single digit with carry
3) Double and single without carry
4) Double and single with carry
5) Double and double without carry - Grade 3
6) Double and double with carry - Grade 4
7) Triple and (single/double) without carry
8) Triple and double with carry
9) Triple and triple with carry

For minus equations:

1) Single digit
2) Single digit
3) Double and single without borrowing
4) Double and single with borrowing
5) Double and double without borrowing
6) Double and double with borrowing
7) Triple and (single/double) without borrowing
8) Triple and double with borrowing
0 Triple and triple with borrowing

For multiplication equations:

1) Single digit times 2 (single digit must be less than or equal to 6)
2) Single digit times 2 (single digit must be less than or equal to 12)
3) Single digit times 3 (single digit must be less than or equal to 6)
4) Single digit times 3 (single digit must be less than or equal to 12)
5) Digit x times digit x (x must be 12 or less)
6) Digit x times digit y (x and y must be 12 or less)
7) Digit x times digit y (x and y must be 12 or less)
8) Double digit times 2 or 3
9) Double en single
